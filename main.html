                I have been studying technology looking to help more and more people as a main goal.
                I created some projects with multiple tools, technologies and methods, for friends, family
                and "random" people -well, if we know each other they are not random anymore- and,
                from my point of view, all this helped me to learn how the market and the world of technology.
                in general -by the way, it's a completely different world-.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
                But something that hasn't 
                changed is the need for someone in need of help, something that motivates me to study 
                and continue to develop creative and unusual solutions for the community.
