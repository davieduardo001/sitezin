                      I write this post, remembering a lecture I attended about ChatGPT, made available by my college. (very good indeed, thank you #ucb), which after one of the professors set out the terms of use of the software causing a fear -I don't think is fear, but u' understand- among some students, something I thought was just a joke at first, however, it wasn't. This post is not about AI, but a thought about who makes the software, and the power that person has.

                      Studies on Human and Machine Interaction began and I notice something, most of the problems we experience today, such as alienation, lack of critical thinking, lack of attention, polarization, etc., were caused by someone. Maybe not a bad person, but someone who thought was doing the right thing, by creating a simple "like button", for example, to make the user's life easier (which is nothing more and nothing less than UX).

                      Yeah, what we don't do for a salary or a name in society, brilliant ideas that corrode humanity. However, hope is the last thing that dies, people are starting to realize how intrusive social networks and apps are that cause our privacy to be breached. As seen in the book “Stolen Focus” by Johann Hari, having our focus back is not a non-individual struggle (stopping using one or another software), but a collective one, where people try to make others aware, to break the monopolization of information and being free to make their own choices without having a notification calling them to see the "last post by the X famous".
