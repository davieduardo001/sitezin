              this week I finished my first big college project, and it was an amazing experience, I met new people
              (people I want to take for the rest of my life, inspirations indeed), I experienced new things, I learned
              how to (not) lead (yes , I was the leader this time this time).

              The research was related to technology in science, even if the focus of the post is not that, but I find
              it interesting to mention, since my work is literally technology. We research future trends with a focus on emerging technologies and the needs of the
              community, resulting in things like quantum computing, nanotechnology, 3d manufacturing, augmented reality
              and much more

              But the most important thing, I think, that I will take from this experience are my friends, whom I have
              already mentioned, without whom this project would not be possible, and I want to record it here. I am so
              grateful for you, thank you for going out of your way to do this research, and thank you for putting up
              with me leading (for trusting me with your hopes)...

              Well, I'm very happy about it, and I'm staying here. Byee

              I write this post, remembering a lecture I attended about ChatGPT, made available by my college. (very
              good indeed, thank you #ucb), which after one of the professors set out the terms of use of the software
              causing a fear -I don't think is fear, but u' understand- among some students, something I thought was
              just a joke at first, however, it wasn't. This post is not about AI, but a thought about who makes the
              software, and the power that person has.

              Studies on Human and Machine Interaction began and I notice something, most of the problems we experience
              today, such as alienation, lack of critical thinking, lack of attention, polarization, etc., were caused
              by someone. Maybe not a bad person, but someone who thought was doing the right thing, by creating a
              simple "like button", for example, to make the user's life easier (which is nothing more and nothing less
              than UX).

              Yeah, what we don't do for a salary or a name in society, brilliant ideas that corrode humanity. However,
              hope is the last thing that dies, people are starting to realize how intrusive social networks and apps
              are that cause our privacy to be breached. As seen in the book “Stolen Focus” by Johann Hari, having our
              focus back is not a non-individual struggle (stopping using one or another software), but a collective
              one, where people try to make others aware, to break the monopolization of information and being free to
              make their own choices without having a notification calling them to see the "last post by the X famous".
